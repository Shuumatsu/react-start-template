Create React apps with no build configuration.

### Creating an App

```
npm install -g clone-react-template

clone-react-template my-app
cd my-app
npm install && npm start
```

It will create a directory called my-app inside the current folder.

Then open [https://localhost:3000/](https://localhost:3000/) to see your app.

When you’re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with `npm run build`.
